options summary

films-0.6: Dolby Countdown looks as though it's 3D.  THX Terminator 2 fucked
(these on default settings)
fq/gradfun --- no obvious effect
hqdn3d --- pretty good denoising
ow --- no obvious effect
tn --- interesting; much noise reduction, bad artefacts on movement, colour tint even in black
unsharp --- worse

Benchmark SWS options: lanczos ?
hqdn3d=0:0:6 ? (turn off chroma/luma blurring)

Lanczos; no visible effect on Ghostbusters.
