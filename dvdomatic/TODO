Thumbnails are poorly named
x-thread signaller
Restartable jobs somehow
restore Tifftranscoder not bothering with audio
trim decoder public / protected API
maybe TranscodingParameters or something to stop the crap with encoder knowing the decoder;
  maybe instead / as well films should store A/B to remove the j2k-extra-dir hack
use something other than TIFF
THUMBS ARE BEING CROPPED!!!!
