/** @mainpage DVD-o-matic
 *
 *  DVD-o-matic is a tool to create digital cinema packages (DCPs) from
 *  video files, or from sets of TIFF image files.  It is written in C++
 *  and distributed under the GPL.
 *
 *  Video files are decoded using FFmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org), so any video
 *  supported by FFmpeg should be usable with DVD-o-matic.  Most testing has, however,
 *  happened with files from DVD.
 *
 *  It is based on OpenDCP (http://code.google.com/p/opendcp), written by Terrence Meiczinger.
 * 
 *  DVD-o-matic is distributed in the hope that there are still cinemas with projectionists
 *  who might want to use it.  As Mark Kermode says, "if it doesn't have a projectionist
 *  it's not a cinema - it's a sweetshop with a video-screen."
