Hello!


Building
--------

./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install


Dependencies
------------

You will need these libraries:

    libdcp (from http://carlh.net/software/libdcp)
    FFmpeg
    libtiff
    boost thread and filesystem
    libopenjpeg

and also the command line tool:

    vobcopy (if you want to rip DVDs straight into DVD-o-matic)


In a nutshell
-------------

The `dvdomatic' program is a GTK front-end which is probably easiest
to use.  It will create a directory for a particular project, and write
its data to that directory.  The basic approach is:

"File->New"; specify a directory.
Choose "Jobs->Copy from DVD" to read a DVD from your drive, if you have one.
Fill in the fields in the window (most importantly the `content' field:
  specify your video, and the `Name' field: give your project [and hence DCP]
  a name.)
Move the slider to see thumbnails; adjust crop if necessary.
Select "Jobs->Make DCP" and go and make a really strong cup of tea.
The DCP will be written to the project's directory; copy this to your
  media server and ingest.

The `Format' field dictates what size your image will be:

- 4:3 within Flat: 1.33:1 images inside a flat (1.85:1) frame; play
  back using the DCI 1.85 / DCI Flat preset on your projector.
- Academy: 1.37:1; play using DCI 1.37 if you have such a thing.
- 16:9 within Flat: 1.78:1 images inside a 1.85:1 frame.
- Flat: 1.85:1 images to the DCI spec.
- Scope: 2.39:1 images to the DCI spec.



Server/client
-------------

Running the `servomatic' program on a remote machine will make it
listen on port 6192 (by default) and process requests from a dvdomatic
instance.  This has been written with no thought to security, so don't
do it over the public internet!  The connection will probably need to
be 1 Gb/s to make it worthwhile.

To tell the client about available servers you will need to go to
Edit->Preferences and add the server's IP address and the number of
parallel threads that the server should execute (make it equal to the
number of CPUs or cores).
