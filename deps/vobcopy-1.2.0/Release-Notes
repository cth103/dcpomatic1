Release-Notes for 1.2.0 (Mo 8. Jun 21:48:19 CEST 2009):
Progress bar and speed enhancements/system load reduction coming with it 
- many thanks to Eric Kilfoil! Also vobcopy can now "rip" from an iso 
image on hdd or a directory containing a VIDEO_TS directory. People seem 
to need this for streaming dvd content to a ps3 via fuppes. That part seem 
to be buggy though, works 50/50. Will look further into that. Added
another option: -M to rip the title with the longest playing time.
Both methods, choosing the main title by longest playing time and most
chapters, can be wrong - please try both if one fails. I will
implement a message indicating that the methods recommend different
"main" titles shortly. Other small corrections are also in I think.

Release-Notes for 1.1.2 (Mi 8. Okt 00:18:17 CEST 2008):
Added german l12n to the messages in vobcopy (if it works..., please
let me know if not). Also some small fixes for *bsd and other fixes.
And introduced in vobcopy to [x]overwrite all existing files or -x to
start that way from the command line.

Release-Notes for 1.0.2 (Su 24. Jun 02:19:04 CEST 2007):
Small fixes all in all: fix segfault with log file writing routine and
some other small fixes. Also a small experimental patch which steps
over broken parts on a dvd (is a copy protection system). Does not
work properly yet...

Release-Notes for 1.0.1 (Mo Nov 13 22:56:00 CET 2006):
Some small fixes. Nothing major. Not everything is up to par but I think
that that bug I'm (slowly) fixing is rare enough that people won't notice
and I think it's better to get it out the door, it's been lying on my hdd
for ages...

Release-Notes for 1.0.0 (So  2 Apr 18:49:46 CEST 2006):
This is it! Vobcopy is "ready" in the sense that it can be in maintainance
mode from now on. I'm working on vobcopy2 (sort of) and that will be
massively re-written. So, until then, enjoy this one here!

Release-Notes for 0.9.0-pre1 (Fr Feb 24 21:15:36 CET 2006):
Backup Release


Release-Notes for 0.5.16 (Wed Dec  7 23:32:50 CET 2005):
Rather minor stuff: -m and -n are mutually exclusive -now they are also in
the code. The size-checking code in the -m part was broken and is hopefully
fixed now. And a typo in the man-page.

Release-Notes for 0.5.15 (Fr Jul 29 04:00:01 CEST 2005):
By a patch from Guy Naor there is now the option to skip already copied
files (from a previous run). Strange dvd's with files ending in ";?" should
now also work.

Release-Notes for 0.5.14 (Thu Nov 18 06:08:53 CET 2004):

There have been some small cleanups that clear up a little what is being 
named what and such... also another small code-path for freebsd

Release-Notes for 0.5.14-rc1 (Son Okt 24 04:00:41 CEST 2004):

Takeshi Nakamura provided quite some patches to get parts of vobcopy to work
better with openbsd, freebsd and solaris. From him I also learned about
netbsd patches from the netbsd folks I incorporated. I dunno what else,
sorry, forgot...
