Here is what resampling we need to do.  Content video is at $C_V$ fps, audio at $C_A$.  

\section{Easy case 1}

$C_V$ and $C_A$ are both DCI rates, e.g.\ if $C_V = 24$, $C_A = 48\times{}10^3$.

\medskip
\textbf{Nothing to do.}

\section{Easy case 2}

$C_V$ is a DCI rate, $C_A$ is not.  e.g.\ if $C_V = 24$, $C_A = 44.1\times{}10^3$.

\medskip
\textbf{Resample $C_A$ to the DCI rate.}

\section{Hard case 1}

$C_V$ is not a DCI rate, $C_A$ is, e.g.\ if $C_V = 25$, $C_A =
48\times{}10^3$.  We will run the video at a nearby DCI rate $F_V$,
meaning that it will run faster or slower than it should.  We resample
the audio to $C_V C_A / F_V$ and mark it as $C_A$ so that it, too,
runs faster or slower by the corresponding factor.

e.g.\ if $C_V = 25$, $F_V = 24$ and $C_A = 48\times{}10^3$, we
resample audio to $25 * 48\times{}10^3 / 24 = 50\times{}10^3$.

\medskip
\textbf{Resample $C_A$ to $C_V C_A / F_V$}
